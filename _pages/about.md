Welcome! 
======
I am **Jihoon Shin**, a master's student in Computer Science at UTEP.   
  
From 2016 to 2021, I worked as a Full-Stack Developer at Hyundai AutoEver Corp, the IT service arm of Hyundai Motor Group. I managed and maintained six mission-critical systems for Hyundai Engineering & Construction, including HR, Payroll, and Legal Affairs, while developing and updating system web interfaces and supporting data-related requests from the HR team.

My expertise in IT and HR systems led to an opportunity to join Hyundai E&C’s HR Task Force Team as an IT Manager. In this role, I conducted a comprehensive analysis of the existing HR platform and evaluated multiple Human Resource Management Systems (HRMS) to identify the most suitable solution for the company.

Currently, I am pursuing an M.S. in Computer Science at the University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP), with a research focus on machine learning and meta-learning. As I enter my final semester, my work centers on meta-learning and applied research—particularly exploring how these techniques can be leveraged in domains such as healthcare and mental health.
