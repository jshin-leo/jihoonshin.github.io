Recorded presentation of our accepted paper at the BigCyber-2024 Workshop, part of the 2024 IEEE International Conference on Big Data.  
The talk highlights our use of meta-learning (MAML) to develop models that generalize across unseen malware families using diverse datasets such as BODMAS, Avast-CTU, and MaleVis.
